<blockquote>
  In 2012 I left a position as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics
  at the University of Colorado giving in to a longstanding interest
  in information technology.  Since then I have been working as a
  software engineer and data scientist, developing into the tech lead
  of the team that has been developing the realtime streaming engine
  at KPN.  I am interested in a position with a great team solving
  challenging practical problems.

        Technologies
</h2>

<p>
  I have used all standard platforms (Windows, OS X, and Linux) for
  extended periods of time; for the last years I have mostly been on
  OS X.  I have used different development environments
  (e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio, Intellij, Eclipse, RStudio, and
  vim/emacs with different plugins) for extended periods of time; for
  the last years I have been using mostly the Intellij, RStudio, and
  Emacs environments.
</p>

<p>
  I have developed using many different languages.  Quite a few
  languages for small projects, for instance MIX (the language Knuth
  uses in The art of computer programming) in which I implemented
  Thompson NFA for regular expressions, i86 assembler for some data
  structures, and ML for some theorem proving.  For website
  development html, css, php, and javascript.  C++, Python and java
  for learning these languages a bit and playing with different
  technologies.  C++ with SQL and web languages while I was at CoachR.
  Lots of Clojure (using Cascalog for Hadoop jobs) and R at Adgoji,
  doing analysis of big data (near a TB a day to permanent storage and
  many thousands of events a second).  And currently Scala for flink
  jobs, java for our custom components, and python and bash scripting
  for management of the cluster.

      My Thesis: Cofinitary Groups and Other Almost Disjoint Families
      (written under supervision of Andreas Blass and Yi Zhang)

        <i>Abstract:</i>
        We study two different types of (maximal) almost disjoint
        families: very mad families and (maximal) cofinitary groups. For
        the very mad families we prove the basic existence results. We
        prove that MA implies there exist many pairwise orthogonal
        families, and that CH implies that for any very mad family there
        is one orthogonal to it. Finally we prove that the axiom of
        constructibility implies that there exists a coanalytic very mad
        family. <br />

        Cofinitary groups have a natural action on the natural
        numbers. We prove that a maximal cofinitary group cannot have
        infinitely many orbits under this action, but can have any
        combination of any finite number of finite orbits and any finite
        (but nonzero) number of infinite orbits. <br />

        We also prove that there exists a maximal cofinitary group into
        which each countable group embeds. This gives an example of a
        maximal cofinitary group that is not a free group. We start the
        investigation into which groups have cofinitary actions. The
        main result there is that it is consistent that the direct sum
        of &aleph;<sub>1</sub> many copies of Z<sub>2</sub> has a
        cofinitary action. <br />

        Concerning the complexity of maximal cofinitary groups we prove
        that they cannot be K<sub>&sigma;</sub>, but that the axiom of
        constructibility implies that there exists a coanalytic maximal
        cofinitary group. We prove that the least cardinality
        a<sub>g</sub> of a maximal cofinitary group can consistently be
        less than the cofinality of the symmetric group. <br />

        Finally we prove that a<sub>g</sub> can consistently be bigger
        than all cardinals in Cichon's diagram.

        <i>Abstract:</i>
        We consider the possible cardinalities of the following three
        cardinal invariants which are related to the permutation group
        on the set of natural numbers: <br />

        a<sub>g</sub> := the least cardinal number of maximal cofinitary
        permutation groups; <br />

        a<sub>p</sub> := the least cardinal number of maximal almost disjoint
        permutation families; <br />

        c(Sym(N)) := the cofinality of the permutation group
        on the set of natural numbers. <br />

        We show that it is consistent with ZFC that a<sub>p</sub> =
        a<sub>g</sub> &lt; c(Sym(N)) = 2; in fact we show that in the
        Miller model a<sub>p</sub> = a<sub>g</sub> = &aleph;<sub>1</sub>

        Hirschfeldt and Shore have introduced a notion of stability for
        infinite posets. We define an arguably more natural notion
        called weak stability, and we study the existence of infinite
        computable or low chains or antichains, and of infinite
        &Pi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>-chains and antichains, in infinite
        computable stable and weakly stable posets.  For example, we
        extend a result of Hirschfeldt and Shore to show that every

        infinite low chain or an infinite computable antichain. Our
        hardest result is that there is an infinite computable weakly
        stable poset with no infinite
        &Pi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>-chains or antichains. On the other

        poset contains an infinite computable chain or an infinite
        &Pi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>-antichain.  In Reverse Mathematics,
        we show that SCAC, the principle that every infinite stable
