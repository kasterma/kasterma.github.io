<blockquote>
In 2012 I left a position as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at the
University of Colorado giving in to a longstanding interest in information
technology.  Since then I have been working as a software developer and data
scientist.  I am interested in a position with a great team solving
challenging practical problems.

        Technologies
</h2>

<p>

I have used all standard platforms (Windows, OS X, and Linux) for extended
periods of time; for the last years I have been on OS X.  I have used
different development environments (e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse,
RStudio, and vim/emacs with different plugins) for extended periods of time;
for the last years I have been using mostly the RStudio and Emacs
environments.

</p>

<p>

I have developed using many different languages.  Quite a few languages for
small projects, for instance MIX (the language Knuth uses in The art of
computer programming) in which I implemented Thompson NFA for regular
expressions, i86 assembler for some data structures, and ML for some theorem
proving.  For website development html, css, php, and javascript.  C++, Python
and java for learning these languages a bit and playing with different
technologies.  C++ with SQL and web languages while I was at CoachR.  And
currently mostly Clojure (using Cascalog for Hadoop jobs) and R at Adgoji,
doing analysis of big data (near a TB a day to permanent storage and
many thousands of events a second).

</p>

<p>

For my current work R is the most suited, supported by clojure and java for
interacting with the hadoop stack.  To extract additional speed and
interoperability I am looking into Rcpp to get C++ speeds and use of C++
libraries while working in the interactive R environment.
